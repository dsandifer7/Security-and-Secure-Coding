 This app shows the confidentiality in the CIA triad. It does this by restricting certain functions to predetermined roles.
 Only the admin will be able to delete users, while only the logged in user will be able to update thier username only.
 If an unauthorized user tries to access these functions, they will be denied access and shown an error message.
 This checks for authentication as well as authorization before allowing access to sensitive functions.
